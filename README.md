PowerShell Scripts and Solutions for Alerts and Monitors

This is a repository of the various PowerShell scripts we use in our Enterprise environment. Our current Operations Manager version is System Center Operations Manager 2016. However, these scripts should work within the 2012 R2 or even 2007 environments. 

Each script is designed to be set to the RMS servers C:\Scripts directory and invoked from a Command Channel/Subscriber/Subscription.
